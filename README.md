# Mcramileux's Code Refactoring
1st Challenge: HTML, CSS and Git - Code Refactor

## Description
The challenge aims to refactor the code of a single-page website for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc, a web marketing company, to improve accessibility by adding semantic tags, image alt tags, and other accessibility attributes. 

Additionally, the code will be made more readable and maintainable by reducing redundancy and consolidating CSS selectors, and image assets will be resized to optimize load speed while maintaining visual quality on high-dpi screens.
