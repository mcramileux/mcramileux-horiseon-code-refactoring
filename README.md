## Acknowledgements

 - *Bootcamp Study Group* - I joined up a study  group with my classmate in the bootcamp. I want to extend my appreciation to Rene, Robinson, Fergus, Natasa and for Freddy for organising it. It gave me another set of eyes and brains to how to start with this project especially I don't have any experience in coding.
